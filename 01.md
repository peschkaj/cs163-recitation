# Design

Two main mistakes
1. Not doing design at all
2. Picking the wrong data structures

## Core Functionality for Data Types

Data types always should supply a few key functions:
- Compare
    - Think about what we'll want to compare and then create overloads for it.
    - One for name
    - One for rating
- Copy
- Display
- Initialization

Design and implement these first.
Test the bejesus out of them - that way if something fails in the assignment, we know it's not the four basic code modules.

## Data Structures

Core functionality
- Add 
    - Should just supply the data type to the `add`
- Remove
- Display
- Retrieve 
    - "Get all X out of Y".
- Copy 
    - important to copy nested data structures/pointers/etc

## Building the Software

Start from the specification
Make sure the front most object can interface with the specification correctly.
Multiple layers - each layer may call down to a more specialized ADT

## File Organization

Each data type has a `.h`
Each data structure has a `.h`
Match this with the `.cpp` files
Use an **include guard** in the header file to prevent the redeclaration of things.

``` c++
#ifndef uniquename
#define uniquename
/* Code goes here, moron */
#endif
```

## pointer arithmetic

`ptr` points to the 0th node of an arrays

``` c++
char *array =(char *) "hello";
ptr = array;

cout << ptr;   // prints hello
cout << *ptr;  // prints h

cout << ++ptr; // prints ello
cout << *ptr;  // prints e


```

dereferencing a pointer accesses a single member of an array
the dereference operator (*) has the highest precedence - USE PARENS, DUMBASS
